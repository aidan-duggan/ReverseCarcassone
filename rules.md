Players choose, in order, a central piece of a 3x3 to start in.

Turn over the outer 3 by 3 grid

[o][x][o]
[x][-][x]
[o][x][o]

In reverse player order, each player places another one of their pieces in the center of these grids.

Turn over the remaining tiles in the center.

#### Play

Each turn the active player rolls the dice, and may perform the actions rolls.

They may re-roll the first roll once, choosing which dice to reroll.
They can pay 1 energy to re-roll one dice.

#### Actions:

Energy: Gain one energy
Rotate Left/Right/180: Rotate a tile, that is touching a tile you control, the shown direction.
Swap tiles: swap two tiles that are touching tiles you control, maintaining their orientation.
Place a token: Place on of your control tokens on a tile that is touching a tile you control and which do not break tile control rules.

_Tile Control Rules_
Features on tiles that are touching and controlled by the same player must line up. (carcassone rules but only for the controling player).

#### Scoring

Each player scores their tiles using carcassone rules (no farms). Where features are completed across multiple players, each player scorse for the whole feature, not just the parts they control.

The winners is the person with the most points.
